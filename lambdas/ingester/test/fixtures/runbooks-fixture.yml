# Copy this file to your repository root as
# ./.github/runbooks.yml and edit as appropriate

# These settings determine the behaviour of runbook.md's Runbook Validator bot
# https://github.com/financial-times/runbook.md

# Everything below is optional

runbooks:
    # All available settings are listed below

    # Disable checks for this repo
    # defaults to `false`
    disabled: false

    ### SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE RUNBOOKS IN A SINGLE REPOSITORY

    # Fail checks if `any` | `all` | `none` runbooks fail validation
    # defaults to `any`
    failOn: any

    # an array of paths to exclude from processing (and Biz-Ops updates, if enabled)
    # wrap paths in single quotes
    # RegExp strings supported (prefixed rx:), see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
    exclude:
        - 'rx:test/fixtures'

    ### SUPPORT FOR UPDATING BIZ-OPS

    # Update valid Biz-Ops runbooks on merge to a specific branch
    #### IF YOUR DEPLOYMENTS ARE AUTOMATED (CircleCI, Heroku Pipelines)
    #### PLEASE INTEGRATE WITH CHANGE-API INSTEAD
    #### https://github.com/Financial-Times/change-api#change-api---v2
    # defaults to `false`
    updateOnMerge: false

    # Merges to this branch trigger Biz-Ops updates updateOnMerge is `true`
    # defaults to `master`
    updateBranch: master

    # an array of paths to exclude from Biz-Ops updates (runbooks are still processed)
    # wrap paths in single quotes
    # RegExp strings supported (prefixed rx:), see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
    excludeFromUpdate:
        - 'example-runbook.md'

    ### UPDATING BIZ-OPS REQUIRES EACH RUNBOOK TO BE TIED TO A VALID SYSTEM CODE
    # Mappings between paths and system codes
    # unless a custom mapping is specified here
    # runbook.md tries to parse the system code from the runbook's filename (format: my-sys-code_runbook.md)
    systemCodes:
        # paths are relative to root, omitting ./ (case-insensitive)
        biz-ops-runbook-md: RUNBOOK.MD
        my-system-code: docs/example-runbook.md
